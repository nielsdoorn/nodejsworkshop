Node.js workshop
================

Node.js is a server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications, notably web servers. Programs are written on the server side in JavaScript, using event-driven, asynchronous I/O to minimize overhead and maximize scalability.

It can run on servers, but also on the Raspberry Pi and you can even control a quad copter with it.

JavaScript is a nice language that most people know from client-side usage in web browsers, Node.js makes it possible to use it on the server-side to.

During this workshop you'll get to see what Node.js is and try it out during a hands-on lab.

You'll learn how to write a webserver in it and how to handle events from different sources and how to send events to clients.

You'll need a laptop with node.js, npm and a text editor installed.

The workshop is aimed at people without prior experience with Node.js, but with some programming skills.
